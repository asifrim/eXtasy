Getting started:
================

To install eXtasy:
------------------------
wget http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/eXtasy/current/eXtasy.tar.gz
tar -vxzf eXtasy.tar.gz
cd eXtasy
./install.rb

This will download all the necessary files and unpack all the precomputed gene prioritizations which are needed as a second input in the next step.

Example eXtasy run:
-------------------
./extasy.rb -i ~/data/example.vcf -g ./geneprios/res/HP_0000033_fgs.tsv 

The -i option takes as an argument the path to the vcf-file with the variants that you want to prioritize.
The -g option takes an Endeavour gene prioritization file which can be found in the geneprios/res/ folder. A list of all precomputed phenotypes to choose from is available on the website (http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/eXtasy/current/hpo_terms.tsv). In upcoming versions custom gene prioritization based on a user-defined group of genes will be added.

The output can be found in the same directory as the input vcf file. It will contain two eXtasy scores and all the features used to compute these scores. The eXtasy scores can be found in the last two columns. If no missing values were present for that file the complete random forest model was able to run and will return a score. If missing values were present a less complete model was run, omitting haploinsufficiency scores (as this is the most missing feature) and replacing any further missing values with the median of that feature. The complete model outperforms the imputed model in most cases. 
 
Combining different prioritizations:
------------------------------------
In some cases you might want to combine different prioritizations (e.g. when dealing with different phenotypes). This can be achieved by using Order Statistics (Aerts et al. 2006, Stuart et al. 2006). To compute these order statistics based aggregate rankings you can run the following command:

combine.rb <PRIO_1> <PRIO_2>...<PRIO_N>

Where <PRIO_1> to <PRIO_N> are the individual extasy prioritizations _for the same input file_. This will output a file with all the extasy_scores for the individual prioritizations and the aggregate prioritization. Keep in mind that the aggregate score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is likely to be disease-causing and 1 unlikely to be disease-causing (in contrast with the normal eXtasy scores). This is because this is a pseudo-pvalue that represents the probability that a variant is high-ranking in all different phenotypes given the null-hypothesis of random rankings.


What is eXtasy?
===============
eXtasy is a pipeline for ranking nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants given a specific phenotype. It takes into account the putative deleteriousness of the variant, haploinsufficiency predictions of the underlying gene and the similarity of the given gene to known genes in the given phenotype.
