What is eXtasy?
===============
eXtasy is a pipeline for ranking nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants given a specific phenotype. It takes into account the putative deleteriousness of the variant, haploinsufficiency predictions of the underlying gene and the similarity of the given gene to known genes in the given phenotype.
